## Deep Learning Laboratory Program List

1) Linear regression by using Deep Neural network: Implement Boston housing price 
prediction problem by Linear regression using Deep Neural network. Use Boston House price 
prediction dataset.

2) Classification using Deep neural network (Any One from the following) 
    1. Multiclass classification using Deep Neural Networks: Example: Use the OCR letter 
    recognition dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/letter+recognition
     
    3. Binary classification using Deep Neural Networks Example: Classify movie reviews into 
    positive" reviews and "negative" reviews, just based on the text content of the reviews. 
    Use IMDB dataset

4) [Lab 4] Recurrent neural network (RNN) Use the Google stock prices dataset and design a time 
series analysis and prediction system using RNN.
